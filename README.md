   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### How It Works

The AI analysis:

## Configuration

### Adjusting Scraping Limits

Edit these variables in the script:
```python
SCROLL_DELAY_MS = 800           # Delay between scrolls (milliseconds)
PAGE_TIMEOUT = 60000           # Page load timeout (milliseconds)
```

### Changing Output File

Modify the output filenames:
```python
OUT_CSV = "your_custom_filename.csv"
OUT_JSON = "your_custom_filename.json"
```

## Supported Cities

The scraper automatically detects and assigns zipcodes for:
- Tampa, FL
- San Francisco, CA
- Miami, FL
- Orlando, FL
- Jacksonville, FL
- Atlanta, GA
- New York, NY
- Los Angeles, CA
- Chicago, IL
- Houston, TX
- And any other US city (with fallback logic)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError"**: Make sure you've activated your virtual environment and installed requirements
2. **Browser issues**: Run `playwright install` to install browser dependencies
3. **Timeout errors**: Increase `PAGE_TIMEOUT` or `SCROLL_DELAY_MS` values
4. **No data scraped**: Check if the website structure has changed or if you're being rate-limited

### Rate Limiting

The scraper includes built-in delays to be respectful to the website:
- 1-second delay between property requests
- 800ms delay between page scrolls
- Automatic timeout protection

## Dependencies

- **playwright**: Web automation and scraping
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV export
- **zipcodes**: US zipcode database and lookup
